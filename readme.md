##Use object-oriented JavaScript to model a public library (w/ three classes: Library, Shelf, & Book). *
The library should be aware of a number of shelves. Each shelf should know what books it contains. Make the book object have "enshelf" and "unshelf" methods that control what shelf the book is sitting on. The library should have a method to report all books it contains. In addition to pushing this .js file to your Github account, please also setup a http://jsfiddle.net/ with the solution and enter the saved URL here so we can take a look.



##Make a simple html page that uses jQuery to manage Todos *
It should have an input field. When the user enters text in the input field, show that input in the page. When an existing item is clicked, it should disappear from the page. In addition to pushing the answer to your Github account, please also setup a http://jsfiddle.net/ with the solution and enter the saved URL here so we can take a look.



##Generate a Backbone.js, Ember.js, AND/or Spine.js app that allows a user to create, edit, update, and destroy (delete) users. *
Users should have first name, last name, and email address fields. First name is required. Email should be a valid email. If you breezed through this challenge, add extra features to this app (be creative) and tell us what you did so we donâ€™t miss it. Please deploy this app live somewhere (e.g. a free Heroku account) so we can interact with it (be sure to enter the URL here).
